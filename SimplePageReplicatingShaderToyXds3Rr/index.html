Simple page attempting to replicate essential behavior from <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xds3Rr">https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Xds3Rr</a>.

</p>
<p>

Essential notes from the actual page:

</p>

<ul>

<li> The HTMLAudioElement is instantiated in ShaderToy's <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/js/effect.js">effect.js</a> via <code>document.createElement('audio')</code>, line 1524.
<li> Its src is set up at line 1627 in the same file.
<li> Its initial call to play() is made inside the <code>canPlay</code> event listener at line 1583.
<li> Afterward, when toggling the play/pause button on the page, calls to <code>HTMLAudioElement.play()</code> are made inside <code>EffectPass.prototype.ResumeInput</code> in the same file, line 660.
<li> The event handler for the play/pause button is in <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/js/pgWatch.js">pgWatch.js</a>, line 381.

</ul>

<p>

As far as I can tell, the MEI score does not increase when toggling the play/pause button on the site, even though those calls to play() happen inside an event handler with a user gesture.
